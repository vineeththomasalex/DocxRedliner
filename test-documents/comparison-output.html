          <div class="block block-unchanged para-paragraph">Computer Security has always been one of my prime interest areas. The numerous concepts involved in protecting information, authenticating access to it and transferring it securely are endlessly fascinating. As the world gets more connected, the role of security becomes more crucial. My experience as a Software Engineer at Texas Instruments and my undergraduate projects have helped me understand the importance of security in a system. While my final aim is to achieve a PhD in Computer Science, my immediate goal is to pursue a graduate degree and to undertake a focused study in Network Security.</div>
<div class="block block-modified para-paragraph" data-change-id="change-0">My current project at TI involves development and optimisation of Bluetooth Low Energy software stack for TI’s ultra-low power security MCUs. Balancing features, timing precision and power consumption requires extensive research and experimentation and has proved to be both challenging and highly rewarding. I have previously worked on projects like AUTOSAR safety drivers and DLP devices. As a Software Engineer for catalog MCU products, I supported customer requests through TI’s E2E forum. After noticing many queries about the N2HET module which is a timer micromachine, I initiated an application report titled “PWM Generation and Input Capture Using HALCoGen N2HET Module”. This publication involved around half a year of research and empirical analysis, especially in understanding the timing limitations of the N2HET module. <span class="diff-delete">The document outlined the theoretical performance limits, comparison with experimental outcomes and an explanation for the differences. </span>This research was also paramount in improving the precision of the software driver of the HALCoGen N2HET module by 4 bits. This work was peculiarly satisfying and strengthened my resolve to pursue a career in research. </div>
<div class="block block-unchanged para-paragraph">During my undergraduate studies, courses like Number Theory and Cryptography, Computer Networks and Computer Security easily captured my curiosity with the elegant concepts involved in authentication and encryption. I was both captivated and excited by the open vulnerabilities of existing systems. As part of the Computer Security course, my team and I executed a project to implement and to investigate the behaviour of trojan bots which use steganography to communicate via Google+. This project required a great deal of study on existing strategies for bot control and inspired my interest on many levels. </div>
<div class="block block-unchanged para-paragraph">As a sophomore, I served as the coordinator of the NITC Blood Donors’ forum in addition to being an active donor. In my senior year, I was the College Placement Secretary and was the sole point of contact for recruiting companies. Even while being committed to other causes, I have consistently performed well academically, which is testimony to my abilities in time management. My performance in GATE 2015, the national graduate entrance exam in engineering, securing the 40th rank out of 115425 candidates, gives me confidence that I will be able to fit into the rigorous academic environment at NCSU. </div>
<div class="block block-unchanged para-paragraph">Given the Computer Science Department’s great track record and the unique wealth of expertise in the fields of computer networks and cyber security, I believe NCSU is the logical next step for me. The research of  Dr William Enck and Dr Peng Ning on mobile security closely aligns with my own interests. Dr. Rudra Dutta’s research on optical communication and wireless networking is also compelling. I am also curious to explore the interplay of security with other fields like communication complexity, distributed computing and machine learning. I believe that my industry experience in embedded security software and communication protocols will add to my potential to gain a more holistic perspective on this subject and contribute to ongoing research. I hope my combined academic and professional background and my penchant for computers can come together under the guidance of the Department of Computer Science at NCSU.</div>
